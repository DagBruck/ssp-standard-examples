# Cauer low pass filter with analog components

The example Cauer Filter is a low-pass-filter of the fifth order.
It is realized using an analog network. The voltage source V is the input voltage (step), and the R2.p.v is the filter output voltage.
The pulse response is calculated.

The simulation end time should be 60 seconds. Please plot both V.p.v (input voltage) and R2.p.v (output voltage).

The example comes from the Modelica Standard Library 4.0 and the SSD file was exported by Dymola 2025x.
